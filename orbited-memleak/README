What is this thing?

clshim: the backend socket server, it sends one short message per second to all clients
cometsim: a hacked up emulation of the http requests a browser would make, originally created for load testing, it connects all clients initially and they stay connected indefinitely
watchmem.sh: a handy script for logging orbited memory usage
orbited-log: a log with 100 clients left overnight, memory usage grew from 20M to 117M
orbited.cfg: the config file I used
README: this file

Ok, how do I use it?

You will need the development packages for curl and pthreads installed, as well as a C++ compiler. Tested only on Linux with GCC and Orbited 0.7.10.

First, compile:
make

Now, run the following each in its own terminal (for readability):
./clshim
orbited -c ./orbited.cfg
./cometsim 100 #that's 100 clients
./watchmem.sh

Further notes

Orbited appears to leak memory regardless of how many clients you connect, but the memory leaks accelerate with increasing numbers of clients. I have verified this up to about 5000 clients.
